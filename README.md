# ECGRID
The ECMWF grid point barotropic shallow-water model according to some documents, such as Burridage,1977.

It is developed on regular latitude-longitude grid, and I also extend it both for u at poles and v at poles with Arakawa-C grid.

The following test cases are provided:

(1) Mountain zonal flow (Williamson,1992)

(2) Rossby-Haurwitz wave (Williamson,1992)

(3) Cross pole flow (McDonald and Bates,1989)

(4)Jet_zonal_flow (Galewsky,2004)
